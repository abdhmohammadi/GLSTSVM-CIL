# Data
> Using two-dimensional synthetic data, the position of hyperplanes and the performance of the method against changes in the imbalance ratio are evaluated

> KEEL repositoy was used to evaluate the performance on imbalance and noisy datasets.

> The data available in <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml">UCI (Dua and Graff (2017))</a> and Kaggle repositories were used to evaluate medical applications.
 
> Text data from UCI, Kaggle and <a href="http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/TextData.html">TDT2</a> dataset (Cai (2024)) have been used to evaluate models in text data classification.

> To evaluate Proposed Method‚Äôs performance on large datasets, the <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/dmi/svm/ndc/"> NDC (Normal Distributed Clusters)</a> dataset Musicant (1998) was utilized.

> **"An Angle-based Least Squares Generalized Weighted LSTSVM for Class Imbalance Learning"**  
> Submitted to *Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computation*, 2025.

Our proposed method is designed for binary classification tasks with high class imbalance and Gaussian noise. It integrates fuzzy membership weighting and angle-based optimization, outperforming other LS-SVM variants such as LS-ATWSVM and LSFLSTSVM-CIL.

## üß™ Highlights

- Effective under varying class imbalance ratios (1:1 to 1:20)
- Robust to additive Gaussian noise (mean = 0, variance = 1)
- Combines the strengths of both fuzzy weighting and angle-based boundary design
- Evaluated with four performance metrics: **Accuracy**, **F1-Score**, **G-Mean**, and their **average**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.9 or later installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the Code

To reproduce the main experiments on synthetic datasets with Gaussian noise and varying imbalance ratios:

```bash
python src/alsgw_lstsqvm.py
```

You can also explore the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/experiments.ipynb
```

## üìä Sample Result

The figure below demonstrates model performance across varying class imbalance ratios:

![Imbalance Rate Chart](results/figures/Figure_1.png)

- **Top-left**: Accuracy  
- **Top-right**: F1-score  
- **Bottom-left**: G-Mean  
- **Bottom-right**: Average of all three metrics  

The proposed method shows superior or equal performance in most scenarios, particularly due to its integrated dual-weight optimization structure.
